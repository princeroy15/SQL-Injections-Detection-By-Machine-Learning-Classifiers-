# SQL-Injections-Detection-By-Machine-Learning-Classifiers-
SQL Injection is one of the top 10 vulnerabilities  in web-based systems. This attack essentially penetrates  the logical section of the database. If the database has a  logical flaw, the attackers send a new type of logical  payload and get all of the user's credentials. Despite the  fact that technology has advanced significantly in recent  years, SQL injections can still be carried out by taking  advantage of security flaws. On the Kaggle SQL Injection  Dataset, I used multiple machine learning methods  to identify and detect SQL Injection assaults, including  Logistic Regression, AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting),  Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) Classifier. According to this research,  the best strategy for detecting SQL inject is Naive Bayes,  which has an accuracy of 98.33, which is 2% better than  previous work.
